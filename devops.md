We will be using [now](https://zeit.co/now) service for deploying our projects (Both backend and frontend)

* Install now CLI
```bash
npm install --global now
```

* Check if installation was successful
```bash
now --version
```

* To deploy your project/app, simply go inside the folder and type `now`. (Ensure that you are in the folder which contains either a `package.json`  file or `Dockerfile`)
